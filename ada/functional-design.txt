ADA - Access dCache API
Functional design / manual

Some design ideas:
* Defaults will be loaded from
  * /etc/ada
  * the personal folder of the user (~/.ada?)
  * the project space
* Defaults may contain:
  * Macaroon lifetime
  * IP adress caveat
  * Default file to store/read a macaroon


Usage:
ada <action> <arguments>

  init --path <dCache-directory> --duration <ISO duration> --ip <ip>[,<ip2>,<...>]

      Create a macaroon that will be used for authentication.
      The macaroon can be limited by a lifetime and a client
      network specification.
      Macaroons will be saved in ... (project space?)
      Besides a plain text file, also an rclone file will be created
      for operations that require rclone (such as parallel copying of dirs).

  list <dCache-directory>

      List a file or the contents of a directory.
  
  copy [--parallel] <source> <target>

      Copies a file or directory to or from dCache.
      With --parallel on a directory, rclone will be used
      which will do 4 concurrent transfers.
